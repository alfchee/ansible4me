# Ansible4me

This are the configs that I would be using commonly for an **Ubuntu 18.04**, and I don't want to be manually configuring.

## What installs
- `NVM`, to manage and install any Node version you want
- `Node.js 10.16.3`, one of the most acceptable in the Cloud Functions services
- Docker

## How to use it

It's very simple, just run 

```
./install-ansible.sh
```
